# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Dashboard
Built an interactive Excel dashboard using PivotTables, Data Model relationships, slicers, and GETPIVOTDATA to deliver dynamic KPI reporting and data-driven insights for hospital emergency room operations.

## Project Overview
The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard is an interactive analytics solution designed to monitor and evaluate key emergency room (ER) performance metrics. The dashboard provides insights into patient flow, wait times, admissions, and departmental referrals, enabling data-driven decision-making to improve operational efficiency and patient experience.

## Problem Statement
Emergency rooms often experience fluctuating patient volumes, long wait times, and uneven resource utilization. Without a consolidated and visual view of operational data, hospital administrators may struggle to identify bottlenecks, manage staffing effectively, and improve patient satisfaction. This project addresses these challenges by transforming raw ER data into actionable insights through an intuitive dashboard.

## Dashboard Objectives
The primary objectives of this dashboard are to:
- Analyze patient volume trends over time
- Monitor average wait times and patient satisfaction scores
- Evaluate admission vs. non-admission rates
- Understand patient demographics and age-group distribution
- Identify department referral patterns
- Support operational planning and performance monitoring

## Key Insights Provided
- Total number of ER visits and monthly trends
- Average patient wait time and satisfaction score tracking
- Admission status comparison (admitted vs. not admitted)
- On-time vs. delayed patient attendance analysis
- Gender-wise patient distribution
- Age group-based patient volume analysis
- Department referral distribution to identify high-demand specialties

## Project Usage
This dashboard can be used by hospital administrators, operations managers, and healthcare analysts to:
- Monitor ER performance at a glance
- Identify peak hours and high-demand periods
- Improve staffing and resource allocation
- Reduce patient wait times
- Enhance overall patient experience and satisfaction

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is a publicly available, simulated healthcare dataset created for analytical and educational purposes. It represents emergency room visit data and was used to practice data analysis, visualization, and dashboard development techniques.

## Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Excel (Data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard design)
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
- Slicers and interactive filters
- Data visualization and KPI design

## Business Impact
By consolidating critical ER metrics into a single interactive dashboard, this project enables healthcare stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize resource utilization, reduce operational inefficiencies, and ultimately improve patient care outcomes.
